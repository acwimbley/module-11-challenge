Demonstrating web scraping
This assignment was completed using a number of resources: class materials and ChatGPT.  The most difficult part was resolving the issue with the last graph. 
There were no challenges on setting up Beautiful Soup and using the Developer's Tools.  It was little challenge in learning to seek out what to scrape.  I added two cells, one isolaating the titles and one isolating the preview text just to validate pulling the right data using the correct tags.
